# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on 02/22/2025

```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

The file has two sections with different rules for different web crawlers:

1. For all crawlers (`User-agent: *`):
- `Crawl-delay: 10` - Asks all bots to wait 10 seconds between requests to avoid overloading the server
- `Allow: /` - Permits crawling of all pages/directories on the site

2. Specifically for SemrushBot (SEMrush's crawler):
- `Disallow: /` - Completely blocks SEMrush's crawler from accessing any part of the site

This configuration suggests that the site owner wants to:
- Allow most search engines and crawlers to index their site, but at a controlled pace
- Specifically prevent SEMrush (a competitive analysis tool) from gathering data about their site
